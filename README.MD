This is my personal project management tool I made throughout many many years.
I originally built it back in 2016, in part to have a system to email me about homework assignments 3 days in advance so I could get extra credit on them.

Currently it is usable, but is a little ugly and could use some modern React magic.
The project uses my personal PHP Library that I built a long time ago, in particular the Table class.
For security concerns I think in the future I should update it to use PDO instead.

There are a lot of features and updates I would like to make to it, but I have not done so yet.
Feel free to look around and shoot me a message if you have a suggestion!
